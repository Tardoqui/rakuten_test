# rakuten_test  (Version 1.0)
Test for Embedded Analyst at Rakuten Advertising


**Overview**

This project, now at Version 1.0, automates web scraping for both static and dynamic websites using tools like requests, BeautifulSoup, and Selenium. Developed with the tools available at the moment, this solution demonstrates the feasibility of web scraping within the constraints of current resources.
The project is designed with scalability in mind, allowing for easy updates as new requirements arise. It could also be implemented in an RPA tool like Automation Anywhere, following the same conditions and rules established in the code. While the core functionality is complete, additional work can further optimize this project. With more time, a fully comprehensive version addressing all aspects of scraping automation could be developed.
